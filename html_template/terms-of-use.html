                        <p class="terms-section__txt fs18 c-gray font-medium">Arbitration. You agree that all disputes
                            between You and Agentero (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) arising out of
                            or relating to these Terms, the Website, the Agentero Platform and/or Privacy Policy shall
                            be finally resolved by arbitration before a single arbitrator conducted in the English
                            language via teleconference or, if requested by You, in Berkeley, California, U.S.A., in
                            each case under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
                            (“AAA”) and You and Agentero hereby expressly waive trial by jury. You and Agentero shall
                            appoint as sole arbitrator a person mutually agreed by You and Agentero or, if You and
                            Agentero cannot agree within thirty (30) days of either party’s request for arbitration,
                            such single arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA upon the request of either party. Each
                            party shall equally bear the costs of the arbitration, except that, if You are an individual
                            (not a corporate or similar entity), Agentero will bear the reasonable cost of the
                            arbitrator and the AAA; in any event, each party will bear the cost of their own counsel.
                            All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties and enforceable
                            in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding this, application may be made to any
                            court for a judicial acceptance of the award or order of enforcement. Notwithstanding the
                            foregoing, either You or Agentero shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, security or
                            other equitable remedies from any court of competent jurisdiction. Under no circumstances
                            shall the arbitrator be authorized to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with
                            these Terms (including without limitation Section 4 above) or to award punitive damages,
                            including but not limited to pursuant to federal or state statutes permitting multiple or
                            punitive awards. This Section 6 shall survive the expiration or termination of this
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p class="terms-section__txt fs18 c-gray font-medium">Waiver of Class Actions. Any claims
                            brought by You or Agentero must be brought in the party’s individual capacity, and not as a
                            plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Neither You
                            nor Agentero will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims
                            covered by these Terms. You hereby waive any and all rights to bring any claims related to
                            these Terms and Privacy Policy as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or
                            representative proceeding. You may bring claims only on Your own behalf.</p>
                        <p class="terms-section__txt fs18 c-gray font-medium">Opt Out. You may opt out of this agreement
                            to arbitrate in this Section 6. If You do so, neither You nor Agentero can require the other
                            to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, You must notify Agentero in writing
                            within thirty (30) days of the date that You first became subject to this arbitration
                            provision. The opt out notice must state that You do not agree to the Agreement to Arbitrate
                            and must include Your name, address, phone number, Your login credentials to which the opt
                            out applies and a clear statement that You want to opt out of this agreement to arbitrate.
                            You must sign the opt out notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way You
                            can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. You must use this address to opt out: Agentero,
